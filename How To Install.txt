   CodeBlocks / MinGW
  Installing CodeBlocks, MinGW and GLUT

    Install CodeBlocks and MinGW: Goto http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads. Click "Download the binary release". Select your operating platform (e.g., Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7). Download the installer with GCC Compiler, e.g., codeblocks-13.12mingw-setup.exe (98 MB) (which includes MinGW's GNU GCC compiler and GNU GDB debugger).
    Install GLUT: For MinGW, we need to install GLUT separately. Download freeglut (@ http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/index.php). I recommend using the pre-package version for MinGW (freeglut 2.8.0 MinGW Package) available at http://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/.
Download, unzip and copy header files from "include\GL" to "<MINGW_HOME>\include\GL"; the libraries from "lib" to "<MINGW_HOME>\lib", and shared library from "bin" to "<MINGW_HOME>\bin" (which should be included in the PATH environment variable), where <MINGW_HOME> is the MinGW installed directory.

  Writing Your First OpenGL Program

    Create a new project: File ? New ? Project... ? Console Application ? GO ? C++ ? In "Project title", enter "hello" ? Next ? Finish.
    Open "main.cpp", and replace with the code, as shown

/*
 * GL01Hello.cpp: Test OpenGL C/C++ Setup
 */
#include <windows.h>  // For MS Windows
#include <GL/glut.h>  // GLUT, includes glu.h and gl.h
 
/* Handler for window-repaint event. Call back when the window first appears and
   whenever the window needs to be re-painted. */
void display() {
   glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f); // Set background color to black and opaque
   glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);         // Clear the color buffer
 
   // Draw a Red 1x1 Square centered at origin
   glBegin(GL_QUADS);              // Each set of 4 vertices form a quad
      glColor3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f); // Red
      glVertex2f(-0.5f, -0.5f);    // x, y
      glVertex2f( 0.5f, -0.5f);
      glVertex2f( 0.5f,  0.5f);
      glVertex2f(-0.5f,  0.5f);
   glEnd();
 
   glFlush();  // Render now
}
 
/* Main function: GLUT runs as a console application starting at main()  */
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
   glutInit(&argc, argv);                 // Initialize GLUT
   glutCreateWindow("OpenGL Setup Test"); // Create a window with the given title
   glutInitWindowSize(320, 320);   // Set the window's initial width & height
   glutInitWindowPosition(50, 50); // Position the window's initial top-left corner
   glutDisplayFunc(display); // Register display callback handler for window re-paint
   glutMainLoop();           // Enter the infinitely event-processing loop
   return 0;
}


    Configure the libraries: Right-click on the project ? Build Option... ? Linker Settings ? In "Link Libraries" ? Add ? enter "freeglut" ? Add ? enter "glu32" ? Add ? enter "opengl32".
    There is no need to configure the "include-paths" and the "library-paths", as they are implicitly defined.
    Build (right-click on the project ? Build) and Run (Select "Build" menu ? Run).
