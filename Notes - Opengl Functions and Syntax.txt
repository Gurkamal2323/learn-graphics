 INTRODUCTION

OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is an application program interface (API) that is used to define 2D and 3D computer graphics.
The interface consists of over 250 different function calls which can be used to draw complex three-dimensional scenes from simple primitives. OpenGL was developed by Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) in 1992 and is widely used in CAD, virtual reality, scientific visualization, information visualization, and flight simulation.
OpenGL's basic operation is to accept primitives such as points, lines and polygons, and convert them into pixels. This is done by a graphics pipeline known as the OpenGL state machine.

FEATURES OF OpenGL :-

    Geometric Primitives Allow you to construct mathematical descriptions of objects.
    Color coding in RGBA (Red-Green-Blue-Alpha) or in color index mode.
    Viewing and Modeling permits arranging objects in a 3-dimensional scene, move our camera around space and select the desired vantage point for viewing the scene to be rendered.
    Texture mapping helps to bring realism into our models by rendering images of realistic looking surfaces on to the faces of the polygon in our model.
    Materials lighting OpenGL provides commands to compute the color of any point given the properties of the material and the sources of light in the room.
    Double buffering helps to eliminate flickering from animations. Each successive frame in an animation is built in a separate memory buffer and displayed only when rendering of the frame is complete.
    Anti-aliasing reduces jagged edges in lines drawn on a computer display. Jagged lines often appear when lines are drawn at low resolution. Anti-aliasing is a common computer graphics technique that modifies the color and intensity of the pixels near the line in order to reduce the artificial zig-zag.
    Gouraud shading is a technique used to apply smooth shading to a 3D object and provide subtle color differences across its surfaces.
    Z-buffering keeps track of the Z coordinate of a 3D object. The Z-buffer is used to keep track of the proximity of the viewer's object. It is also crucial for hidden surface removal
    Transformations: rotation, scaling, translations, perspectives in 3D, etc.


GLUT Fuctions :-
The OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) is a programming interface with ANSI C and FORTRAN bindings for writing window system independent OpenGL programs.

glutInit :-  glutInit is used to initialize the GLUT library.

Syntax:-  void glutInit(int *argcp, char **argv);

argcp
A pointer to the program's unmodified argc variable from main. Upon return, the value pointed to by argcp will be updated, because glutInit extracts any command line options intended for the GLUT library.
argv
The program's unmodified argv variable from main. Like argcp, the data for argv will be updated because glutInit extracts any command line options understood by the GLUT library.

glutInitWindowPosition, glutInitWindowSize :- 
glutInitWindowPosition and   glutInitWindowSize set the initial window position and size respectively.
